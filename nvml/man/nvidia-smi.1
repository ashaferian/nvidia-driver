nvidia-smi [OPTION1 [ARG1]] [OPTION2 [ARG2]] ...


.PP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
nvidia-smi (also NVSMI) provides monitoring and management capabilities for each of NVIDIA\(aqs Tesla, Quadro, GRID and GeForce devices from Fermi and higher architecture families. GeForce Titan series devices are supported for most functions with very limited information provided for the remainder of the Geforce brand.
NVSMI is a cross platform tool that supports all standard NVIDIA driver-supported Linux distros, as well as 64bit versions of Windows starting with Windows Server 2008 R2.
Metrics can be consumed directly by users via stdout, or provided by file via CSV and XML formats for scripting purposes.
.PP
Note that much of the functionality of NVSMI is provided by the underlying NVML C-based library.
See the NVIDIA developer website link below for more information about NVML. 
NVML-based python bindings are also available.
.PP
The output of NVSMI is not guaranteed to be backwards compatible. However, both NVML and the Python bindings are backwards compatible, and should be the first choice when writing any tools that must be maintained across NVIDIA driver releases.

.SS "\-dm TYPE, \-\-driver\-model=TYPE"
.SS "\-fdm TYPE, \-\-force\-driver\-model=TYPE"
Enable or disable TCC driver model.
For Windows only.
Requires administrator privileges.
\fI\-dm\fR will fail if a display is attached, but \fI\-fdm\fR will force the driver model to change.
Will impact all GPUs unless a single GPU is specified using the \fI\-i\fR argument.
A reboot is required for the change to take place.
See \fBDriver Model\fR for more information on Windows driver models.

.SS "     \-\-gom=MODE"
Set GPU Operation Mode: 0/ALL_ON, 1/COMPUTE, 2/LOW_DP
Supported on GK110 M-class and X-class Tesla products from the Kepler family.
Not supported on Quadro and Tesla C-class products.
LOW_DP and ALL_ON are the only modes supported on GeForce Titan devices.
Requires administrator privileges.
See \fIGPU Operation Mode\fR for more information about GOM.
GOM changes take effect after reboot.
The reboot requirement might be removed in the future.
Compute only GOMs don't support WDDM (Windows Display Driver Model)

.SS "\-r, \-\-gpu\-reset"
Trigger a reset of one or more GPUs.
Can be used to clear GPU HW and SW state in situations that would otherwise require a machine reboot.
Typically useful if a double bit ECC error has occurred.
Optional \fI\-i\fR switch can be used to target one or more specific devices.
Without this option, all GPUs are reset.
Requires root.
There can\(aqt be any applications using these devices (e.g. CUDA application, graphics application like X server, monitoring application like other instance of nvidia-smi).
There also can\(aqt be any compute applications running on any other GPU in the system.

Any GPUs with NVLink connections to a GPU being reset must also be reset in
the same command.
This can be done either by omitting the \fI\-i\fR switch, or using the
\fI\-i\fR switch to specify the GPUs to be reset.
If the \fI\-i\fR option does not specify a complete set of NVLink GPUs to reset,
this command will issue an error identifying the additional GPUs that must be
included in the reset command.

GPU reset is not guaranteed to work in all cases. It is not recommended for production environments at this time.
In some situations there may be HW components on the board that fail to revert back to an initial state following the reset request.
This is more likely to be seen on Fermi-generation products vs. Kepler, and more likely to be seen if the reset is being performed on a hung GPU.

Following a reset, it is recommended that the health of each reset GPU be verified before further use.
The nvidia-healthmon tool is a good choice for this test.
If any GPU is not healthy a complete reset should be instigated by power cycling the node.

Visit \fIhttp://developer.nvidia.com/gpu-deployment-kit\fR to download the GDK and nvidia-healthmon.

HW Thermal Slowdown and HW Power Brake will be displayed on Pascal+.

This is an indicator of:
.br
* Temperature being too high (HW Thermal Slowdown)
.br
* External Power Brake Assertion is triggered (e.g. by the system power supply) (HW Power Brake Slowdown)
.br
* Power draw is too high and Fast Trigger protection is reducing the clocks

.TP 15

.TP 15
.B "Pending"

.SS "ECC Errors"
NVIDIA GPUs can provide error counts for various types of ECC errors.
Some ECC errors are either single or double bit, where single bit errors are corrected and double bit errors are uncorrectable.
Texture memory errors may be correctable via resend or uncorrectable if the resend fails.
These errors are available across two timescales (volatile and aggregate).
Single bit ECC errors are automatically corrected by the HW and do not result in data corruption.
Double bit errors are detected but not corrected.
Please see the ECC documents on the web for information on compute application behavior when double bit errors occur.
Volatile error counters track the number of errors detected since the last driver load.
Aggregate error counts persist indefinitely and thus act as a lifetime counter.

.PP
A note about volatile counts: On Windows this is once per boot.
On Linux this can be more frequent.
On Linux the driver unloads when no active clients exist.
Hence, if persistence mode is enabled or there is always a driver client active (e.g. X11), then Linux also sees per-boot behavior.
If not, volatile counts are reset each time a compute app is run.

.PP
Tesla and Quadro products from the Fermi and Kepler family can display total ECC error counts, as well as a breakdown of errors based on location on the chip.
The locations are described below.
Location\-based data for aggregate error counts requires Inforom ECC object version 2.0.

.SS "Page Retirement"

NVIDIA GPUs can retire pages of GPU device memory when they become unreliable.

Auto boost allows dynamic GPU clocking based on power, thermal and utilization. When auto boost is disabled the GPU will attempt to maintain clocks at precisely the Current Application Clocks settings (whenever a CUDA context is active). With auto boost enabled the GPU will still attempt to maintain this floor, but will opportunistically boost to higher clocks when power, thermal and utilization headroom allow. This setting persists for the life of the CUDA context for which it was requested.

The "nvidia-smi daemon" starts a background process to monitor one or more GPUs plugged in to the system. It monitors the requested GPUs every monitoring cycle and logs the file in compressed format at the user provided path or the default location at /var/log/nvstats/. The log file is created with system's date appended to it and of the format nvstats-YYYYMMDD. The flush operation to the log file is done every alternate monitoring cycle. Daemon also logs it's own PID at /var/run/nvsmi.pid. By default, the monitoring data to persist includes Power Usage, Temperature, SM clocks, Memory clocks and Utilization values for SM, Memory, Encoder and Decoder. The daemon tools can also be configured to record other metrics such as frame buffer memory usage, bar1 memory usage, power/thermal violations and aggregate single/double bit ecc errors.The default monitoring cycle is set to 10 secs and can be configured via command-line. It is supported on Tesla, GRID, Quadro and GeForce products for Kepler or newer GPUs under bare metal 64 bits Linux.
